## Why do I want to join the FOSS wing?
     During Aparoksha month, FOSS wing was the first wing that has been started and I attended each class althoughmy one PR was cancelled
     but that was very first time I heard about open source.
     Then I had participated in **GitHero-21** but we did not make that. 
     So, I decided to explore things from the basics. Found Udemy course Which was present in a repo of Ritik sir and started learning.
     Visited a lot of people's Github profile. 
     The social media of developers with interesting theme, stuff and git commands have attracted me.
     I am done with that Udemy course, **merged** and **squashed** a lot and now want to **rebase** me skills under the **FOSS** wing.

## What technologies have I worked on in the past?
     Learned Web Dev : HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
