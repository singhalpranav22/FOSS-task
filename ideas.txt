IDEAS FOR PROJECT:
• There should be a question-and-answer platform where juniors can interact with their seniors.
• Many students will have common doubts regarding their colleges, which cannot get clarified from any of the platforms such as Google and Quora. But few students may feel a little uncomfortable talking to their seniors. So here comes the need, A platform where juniors can interact with the seniors and get rendered about the stuff related to their college.
• A website where questions would be asked, answered, followed, and upvoted.
HOW IT CAN BE WORKED:
• Juniors will come up with the questions.
• Juniors have access to ask questions and upvote. Only seniors will have access to answer the questions. This can be done by giving access according to the student IDs.
• Website should be designed in such a way that it accepts only relevant questions and avoids abusive words.
• The questions with more upvotes will be displayed on the home page.

We can develop an app for effective interaction in college as Whatsapp is such a mess and mails are too formal.

-> A portal that makes students' experience of online college more simple and organized. It can display all important announcements and assignment deadlines semester-wise in one place so that students don't have to rely on WhatsApp groups for important information.
-> A portal that displays students' journey in cc, development and other tech fields. It can show leaderboard, cc, cf rankings, github profile and other projects of each member to encourage others to take up new projects.

-> What about an application that will provide some information (resources) or experience about the palcement process of our seniors. It can have resources of what we should avoid and what we should prefer during our placements or internships.
	We can also include some more features like constraining it only to IIITA students (except freshers) and there are lot which can be implemented. The only obstacle can be IIITA managment :((
-> I will also wants to work on this feature request (https://github.com/GeekHaven/GeekHaven-2020/issues/28) of GeekHaven original website, it can be implement easily if I provided with a team. (may consider it as a project)
