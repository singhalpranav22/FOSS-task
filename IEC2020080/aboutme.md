###Why you want to join the FOSS wing?
In recent times, especially in India, <b>students</b> (generally newcomers) has misunderstood the 
meaning of open-source.They thought open-source is not more than any competitive program 
(like GSoC or Outreachy), they generally came at the beginning of these programs, they contribute, 
if they got selected, they continue otherwise they leave it or comment <b>"I will try next year".</b> This is not open-source, open-source
should be like a hobby, we should feel fun while doing contributions, if you take it as a burden then
better you leave it and never came back. I can describe more, but I will conclude this with <b>"To explain the real meaning
and benefits of open-source to the community, I will like to join the FOSS wing."<b>
