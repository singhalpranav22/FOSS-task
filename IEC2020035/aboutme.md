## **Section 2:** SOP

**Why do I want to join the FOSS Wing?**  
Being a part of the "Internet Generation", I have learnt almost all of my technical skill from the projects shared by the HUMONGOUS and ever-expanding community of the open-source developers around the world. Hence, it is not only my wish, but my conscious duty to give back to the pool. Hence, FOSS is a great opportunity for me to take concrete steps towards this goal.

## **Section 3:** Experience

In the past, I have worked with:
- Raspberry Pi platform (Worked with peripherals like camera, GPIO etc)
- Apache Server (Used in an undocumented project, on Rasbian OS)
- Python Telegram Bots
- Blynk IoT Platform
- Bluetooth Technology (Using Arduino, undocumented project)
